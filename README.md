- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dahar72
- 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data sciences, and coding, I have worked with C#, Python, HTML, CSS and R primarily in the past. Java and SAS were learned first while I was in school, while Python and R came later while I was focusing more on data analysis.
- 
- ðŸŒ± I currently hold a BS in Management Information System and Business Analytics with a minor in Computer Programming from the Colorado State University, and am hoping to start working towards a Master's in AI or Computer Science. I have also studied through Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate and have currently been learning how to use R more effectively, while simultaneously learning how amazingly useful the tidyverse package is.
