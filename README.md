- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dahar72
- 
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data sciences, and coding, I have worked with Java, Python and R primarily in the past. Java was learned first while I was in school, 
-   while Python and R came later while I was focusing more on data analysis.
- 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use R more effectively, and am learning how amazingly useful the tidyverse is.
